1. What is the preprocessed output for the line where you make system calls for the time method and the delay method.

2. What is the assembly language code near where the system call is actually made (note: You may not directly see the interrupt being called, as the syscall may be wrapping you code in more library code prior to performing the trap to the OS.

3. Can you see a relationship between the numbers in the assembly language code, the numbers in the preprocessed source code, and the numbers in the documentation on kernelgrok?

4. Why does the actual delay not match the ideal delay?

5. Did you ever have a negative actual delay print out?  If so, what error did you make that caused this to occur?
